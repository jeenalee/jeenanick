Please let us know if you're bringing a guest with you and about your dietary restrictions. FYI, Hamlet serves pork centric dishes.

We would like to politely decline any gifts. We appreciate the thought, though. If you still really want to give us gifts, please donate to charities. We especially like:

- [350](https://act.350.org/donate/build/) for alleviating climage change
- [EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate) for defending our digital rights
- [Planned Parenthood](https://secure.ppaction.org/site/Donation2?df_id=12913&12913.donation=form1&s_src=Evergreen_c3_PPNonDirected_banner) for keeping all of us healthy and safe
- [ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/protect-rights-freedoms-we-believe) for protecting our civil rights
- [your local foodbank](http://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank/) for feeding our less fortunate neighbors
